# **OpenClipart** - Public domain clip art collection

## OVERVIEW
This is a collection of 100% license-free, royalty-free, and restriction-free art that you can use for any purpose.  
Most of the art in this package is in the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) format, which is an XML format approved by the W3C and used in a wide range of software applications, including Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, Batik, and more.  
The goal of the Open Clip Art Library is to provide the public with a huge collection of reusable art.  
Some highlights about this release can be seen in the RELEASE*.svg file.  Also, look in the Examples directory for templates and tutorials on ways to make use of the clipart.
